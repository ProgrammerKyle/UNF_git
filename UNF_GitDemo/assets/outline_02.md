## History - A Time Before VCS
- A lot has happened since the the early days of programming...

### Hypothetical Scenario
* You single dev working on a website for a client.
* Writes up prototype, shares with client, client likes and wants a FEATURE.
* Code up that feature, share with client, client does not like. Delete it.
* Client was just joking, loves that feature, wants it again.

#### How to prevent redoing work already done?
* Keep copies of a file, name differently to keep track of what's what.
* ...But there are growing number of files/pages.
* ...Now the project is getting huge, save versions of entire project?

#### Bringing in help!
* Client says they are hiring someone to help you and also their nephew would like to help. No.
* How do you share the work? "Here are all the copies of the project along with my strange naming convention..."
* Once you got some work done, how do you compare and merge the work into a final copy?
* Work was done by both devs that affected the same files. Compare the two side by side? Yare yare daze!

#### Bringing in MORE help!
* Same process for 3 devs.
* Same process for 4 devs.
* Etc. Etc. Etc.
* Handling all these versions and merging everything together manually is tedious and error prone.

## What Version Control Looks Like
